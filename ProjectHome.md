The package contains wrappers for:

  * Google Maps API (v3)
  * Google/Openstreetmap Static Maps
  * Google Geocoding API
  * Google Directions API
  * Google StreetView

**Update:**

This project has been deprecated, and won't be updated any longer.

It was created during a time where free and open source libraries to embed Google Maps related API's in Delphi applications were not available.

In the meantime, I've switched to a stack of Postgres, PostGIS, OSM, GeoServer and OpenLayers for most of my GIS work. I've got OpenLayers Delphi components that I use instead. If you're interested in those, you can contact me.

If you're looking for a Google Maps wrappers for Delphi that are actively maintained, I recommend switching to GMLib:

Thanks for the nice feedback thank I've received over the years.
